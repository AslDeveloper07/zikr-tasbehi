# 📿 Digital Tasbeh (Zikr Counter)

This project is a digital tasbeh (prayer beads counter) created during a JavaScript learning course. It mimics the traditional tasbeh used for zikr (prayer recitations) with interactive controls and audio playback.

## 📝 Project Description

- The tasbeh counts zikr numbers digitally with a clean UI.
- When the tasbeh tab/button is clicked, it **plays Quran audio**; clicking again **pauses** the audio.
- Pressing **Enter** or **Space** increases the count.
- The active count visually glows with a shadow effect.
- Pressing **Alt** decreases the count (goes backward).
- Pressing **Escape** resets the count to zero.
- The project includes controls for a smooth and interactive zikr experience.

## ✨ Features

- Audio playback control via clicking the tasbeh tab  
- Keyboard support for incrementing, decrementing, and resetting count  
- Glowing shadow effect on the active count number  
- Responsive and user-friendly interface  

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure of the project  
- **CSS3** – Styling and animations  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Logic for counting, audio control, and keyboard events
